                            <h1>Modeling Student Absence Rates for K-12 Schools</h1>
			    <p>
				<strong>Background</strong><br>
				For my thesis, I am interested in researching the spatial and temporal occurrence of student misconduct using the method of Hawkes Point Processes (HPP). 
				I have a master’s degree in secondary education and have been a high school math teacher for the past four years so applying statistics for the
				betterment of education is a personal interest of mine. 
			    </p>
			    <p>
				<strong>Methodology</strong><br>
				In order to apply the method of HPP to student discipline occurrence in time and space, I need data that exhibits the frequency of disciplinary acts by day and location.
				    HPP is a method to model self-exciting events in order to describe the degree of spatial-temporal clustering. Most notably, HPP has been used to model events such as 
				    earthquakes, social media interactions, and criminal activity. For example, the onset of one crime will increase the likelihood of another crime occurring within nearby
				    time and space. 
				To accomplish this, HPP models information regarding an event’s space, time, and magnitude. In my study, the event is a disciplinary action taken on a student. Magnitude 
				    could be a function of the frequency of disciplinary actions, or it could be the ranking of a disciplinary event wherein the rank reflects the act’s severity 
				    (e.g. 1 = verbal warning, 2 = in-school suspension, 3 = out-of-school suspension, 4 = expulsion). Defining magnitude will depend on the data available. Hence, 
				    the type of disciplinary offense is not essential for my study, although it could provide additional insight. 
				I believe HPP will be a notable and novel method to apply to student discipline. Modeling student misconduct using HPP will provide a more in-depth understanding 
				    of the nature of disciplinary occurrence by modeling such phenomena using additional dimensions. 
			    </p>

				<strong>Questions I hope to answer</strong><br>
				<ol>
					<li>Is the event of a disciplinary action taken on a student a self-exciting event? </li>
					<li>How well does HPP describe the spatial-temporal clustering of student disciplinary actions in space, time, and the combination of the two? </li>
					<li>Is there a spatial pattern to schools’ discipline rates within a school district during a school year? </li>
					<li>Is there a temporal pattern to schools’ discipline rates within a school district during a school year?</li>
					<li>Is there a correlation between school discipline and criminal activity within the same region, both in time and space? Perhaps, for example, 
						schools that lie within an area that has higher criminal activity will have higher rates of student discipline. </li>
			
				</ol>
			    </p>
		            <p>
				<strong>Goals I hope to achieve</strong><br>		
				<ol>
					<li>Provide insight into the interaction between successive disciplinary events.</li>
					<li>Identity ‘hotspots’ within a school district, defined as zeniths in discipline both in time and space. </li>
				</ol>
