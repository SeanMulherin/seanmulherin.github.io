            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a teacher, coach, statistician, and researcher.
                Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Statistics at UCLA, building on a foundation that includes a Bachelor’s in Mathematics 
                and a Master’s in Teaching. Before my doctoral studies, I spent five years in the classroom teaching high school math and 
                physics—an experience that lead me to translate complex quantitative ideas into clear, actionable lessons.
                <br><br>
                As a teacher, I’m passionate about mentoring students and helping them develop conceptual understanding and rigourous 
                problem‐solving skills. My lessons are structured in such a way that empowers students to tackle difficult problems by leveraging 
                their prior knowledge, providing them mathematical tools to add to their proverbial toolbox as they discover the utility of the tool in 
                regard to the problem at hand.  
                Whether I’m guiding students through proof techniques or demonstrating real‑world applications of statistics, my goal is always 
                to foster curiosity and confidence. 
                <br><br>
                As a data scientist, I'm eager to analyze data to expose patterns and unearth trends that are novel, rigorous, and helpful.
                I will upload more projects on my portfolio as I develop statistical acuity and discover intriguing insights into our shared community.
                <br><br>
                As a researcher, my primary interest lies in time‑series analysis and point processes. I’m currently developing statistical 
                frameworks that can be applied to infectious disease modeling, with the aim of informing policy and improving real‑world decision‑making. 
                <br><br>
                If you have a project idea or challenge you’d like me to tackle, 
                I’d love to hear from you—please feel welcome and encouraged to reach out using the contact information below.
